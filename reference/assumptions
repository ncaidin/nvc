Key Assumptions and Intentions of NVC
1. All human beings share the same needs.
2. All actions are attempts to meet needs.
3. Feelings point to needs met or unmet.
4. Self connection is the first place to look to connect to ourselves, and to others.
5. Needs are independent of a particular person doing a particular thing.
6. There are an abundance of ways to meet needs.
7. The purpose of NVC is to create an environment in which natural giving is more likely to occur.
8. We trust that if needs are identified, ways to meet those needs will come into our mind. 
9. We are responsible for our own needs and values. At the same time we are most likely to get many of our needs met through interdependence with others.
10. NVC is a practice. It's not something one does. It's ongoing. It's a choice.
