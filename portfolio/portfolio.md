# A Journey of Love and Fear

## An NVC Pre-Assessment Portfolio

### *By and For Neal Caidin, CNVC Certification Candidate*

### *And For Sylvia Haskvitz, CNVC Assessor*

#### **January/February 2025**

## Prologue

> \| *Marshall Rosenberg - "Never do anything that isn\'t play."*

I approach this portfolio in the spirit of Play. And when it hasn't felt
like Play, I remind myself that I am still choosing to do it---to meet
other needs, even when the process feels effortful. I have sometimes
stepped away to attend to more pressing needs, for example, taking care
of financial responsibilities or tending to my family\'s needs.

I recognize that I am always in choice---even when the choices feel
difficult, or I struggle to connect with my needs and creative options.
Being in choice helps me take responsibility for my actions and reclaim
a sense of power over my world to whatever degree is possible. And, more
often than not, that feels good.

## Overview

I have given myself permission to make this document non-linear. I have
chosen to take creative liberty in structuring it, hearing that
everything is a request, and trying to tune in to the purpose of this
process.

The pre-assessment is an opportunity for feedback, deep self-reflection,
and communicating my discoveries in a way that feels alive.

At the same time, I aim to keep it clear and concise. I don't experience
NVC as a linear process; I experience it as the flow of life. I hope
this document conveys this and you receive some joy and insight from
reviewing it. If it accomplishes that, I will call it a success. If it
doesn't, I call it a learning experience.

## Getting Started

I am starting with Love.

A key distinction (KD) is between love as an action vs love as a need
and a feeling.

Feelings change moment-by-moment and last, at most, 90 seconds, unless
we sustain them through our thoughts or stories. When our need for Love
is met, whether through giving or receiving, we may feel peace, comfort,
joy, excitement, arousal, affection, aliveness, amazement, gratitude, or
something else entirely.

Needs are expressions of our deepest values, our life energy. Is there
any word that describes life energy better than Love? I don't know how
many needs exist. A hundred? A thousand? But if I had to choose just
one, I would choose Love. Perhaps all other needs are simply threads in
a tapestry of interconnected energy that leads back to this one.

We can take actions motivated by Love, intending to meet another's need
for Love. But those actions may not land as intended. Actions are
strategies; attempts to meet needs.

Strategies are the bridge between the Invisible (our needs, life energy,
and intention) and the Visible (our actions, our being). This movement,
from the unseen to the expressed, is the beginning of the dance to get
everyone's needs met.

Play is a love language for me, especially in connection with others. It
allows us to meet in a space beyond judgment, beyond story where
presence itself is enough. In this way, Play is communion.

Jim Morrison\'s words, for me, capture the spirit of Love, and the
difficulty of defining it. So while I can explain a key distinction
about Love, I don\'t believe my explanation fully captures its nature.

### Love Hides by Jim Morrison (of Doors fame)

Love hides in the strangest places

Love hides in familiar faces

Love comes when you least expect it

Love hides in narrow corners

Love comes to those who seek it

Love hides inside the rainbow

Love hides in molecular structures

Love is the answer

## Summary of my Journal Entries

I celebrate my growth in Needs Consciousness. My entries showed a
pattern of yearning to be even more conscious and aware that is still
extant. A beautiful yearning.

### Celebrating Growth and Awareness

- **More natural and abundant connection to my needs**. I saw this
  pattern in my journal. I seemed to have a "needs explosion" somewhere
  around 2022.

- **Greater awareness of needs as life energy**, rather than
  transactional. I still forget this sometimes, even though I experience
  this sense of connection to life energy daily. Most likely to forget
  in tense or conflict situations, and focus instead on the language, or
  other strategies of connection or smoothing conflict.

- **Many experiences of "shifting".** For example. I was applying for
  jobs I didn't want in order to fulfill unemployment requirements,
  which left me feeling dread and resistance. After self connecting, I
  realized my resistance stemmed from a misalignment with my value of
  integrity. I wasn't looking for just any job; I was yearning for a
  career shift. Connecting with this sense of integrity brought clarity
  and groundedness. I felt a major shift in my energy. A conversation
  with a RESEA staff member reassured me that focusing on a career
  change was acceptable, which eased my tension. While the process
  didn't change, my relationship with it did, leaving me with greater
  peace and ease.

- **A deeper understanding of Street Giraffe (discussed further under
  Key Differentiations: Idiomatic vs classical Giraffe)**. I used to see
  Street Giraffe as simply translating Classical Giraffe into everyday
  language. Now, I understand it differently. It's not a mechanical
  shift in wording---it's about being deeply connected to needs and
  values in your heart, holding care for the other person, and allowing
  words to emerge naturally from that energy. Sometimes, no words are
  even needed; the shift itself can change the dynamic. While I
  celebrate this realization, it remains a learning edge I'm excited to
  explore further.

- **I celebrate the incredible network of friends, NVC practitioners,
  and supporters in my life.** The richness of these connections brings
  me support and hope. I also celebrate the growth that made this
  possible; I wouldn't have this community without learning to connect
  more openly and deeply. Choosing to step onto the certification path
  has been a key part of this journey, opening doors to meaningful
  connections and learning.

### Recognizing Learning Edges

I celebrate my learning edges. Each step of growth offers new
opportunities to align more fully with my values. As I live in greater
integrity with those values, I feel hopeful about contributing more
meaningfully to the world and my purpose.

Self-acceptance feels central. This isn't a journey toward perfection,
but an ongoing embrace of what it means to be human, with all the blind
spots and frailties that come with it. Accepting my humanness deepens my
connection with others---my brothers, sisters, and nonbinary
kin---through our shared experience of being imperfect and evolving.

And yet, I recognize that language itself can be both connective and
distancing. Even including the term "nonbinary" may create distance for
those who don't accept gender fluidity. Nobody is excluded, yet words
can land differently for different people. I hold this awareness as part
of the ongoing practice of connection.

- **Need for Growth** - Checking in with my body. If I ask myself if I
  have more to learn and grow, it is obvious, and I can feel it in my
  body sensations.

- **Self-Expression** -- I recently attended an in-person workshop with
  Stephanie Bachmann Mattei. I was inspired by a story she shared about
  how she connected with a participant through self-expression when
  other attempts failed. Self-expression remains a learning edge for me,
  especially in conflict. I've questioned whether it's truly a need but
  now see it includes connection, the belief that every voice matters,
  and collaboration to meet more needs. It also ties to authenticity and
  openness. Openness is strongest when rooted in a clear perspective
  while allowing space for new insights.

- **Afraid of Being Seen** -Some part of me is still afraid of being
  seen, worried that visibility might lead to punishment or harm,
  perhaps even physical. This fear seems tied to a "less than" story,
  possibly rooted in childhood trauma. While I occasionally feel
  "greater than" others, the "less than" narrative dominates, often
  limiting my ability to express myself fully and connect with
  others.For example, in my Weaving Water Cohousing community, I shared
  that I was a founder of Eno Commons Cohousing and had a background in
  facilitation and NVC. Despite this, community members have rarely
  called upon me to share my expertise, and I felt uncomfortable
  asserting myself. At the same time, I sought to align with my values,
  collaboration, compassion, and presence. I have received feedback from
  others that it was seen and appreciated. It had an impact. Still, I
  see room to step into my skills more assertively in similar contexts.

- **Fear of Authority (discussed further under Key Differentiations:
  Respect for Authority vs Fear of Authority)** - this is similar to
  Afraid of Being Seen but with the added stakes of a real or perceived
  power differential in the relationship.

- **Taking things personally** - Taking things personally remains a
  significant learning edge for me. Staying with "needs, needs, needs"
  instead of "me, me, me" is a challenge, and I get triggered more often
  than I'd like. One of my biggest triggers is sending texts or emails,
  even when they're well-written. And while they are usually received
  well, the time between sending and receiving feedback can feel
  agonizing. Recently, I volunteered to mediate a conflict in my
  community. After meeting with my co-mediator to align on a plan, I
  sent an email update with the subject line "Conflict Resolution
  Update." Though the content felt compassionate and clear, I
  second-guessed the subject line, fearing it might land poorly. I was
  on edge until I received a response, questioning whether I had "done
  something wrong." While both participants responded positively to the
  email, this pattern of fear and self-criticism persists. I sense it
  stems from deeper trauma, making this a recurring edge for me. Still,
  I'm committed to growth: practicing self-empathy, focusing on needs,
  and trusting my intentions as I navigate these moments.

- **Intimacy -** though still a learning edge, I celebrate my growth in
  dating. I notice the significant differences between my journal
  entries from 2022 to 2024. I have a clearer understanding of the needs
  I'm attempting to meet in dating and relationships. This growth was
  especially evident in my relationship with N.S. With N.S., I shared
  and received vulnerably, held space for both of us, and didn't take
  the blame when she broke up with me. One moment that stood out was
  when she shared something deeply private about her sexuality, saying,
  'If you can't accept this about me, then leave right now!' Her voice
  grew louder, and sounded tight with stress. I stayed with her,
  physically and emotionally. I felt clear, calm and at peace. Another
  key moment was when I shared an email I had written to someone in my
  community about a stressor in my relationship with them. Though brief
  and intended to express curiosity, the email triggered N.S.'s need for
  safety and self-protection. I stayed present to her needs without
  taking on blame. These experiences helped me grow in my ability to
  remain grounded, present, and authentic in an intimate relationship.
  Looking ahead, I seek a relationship rooted in growth, intimacy,
  mutual support, love, and a shared commitment to working through
  challenges together. I want a partner who values inner work and sees
  difficulty as an opportunity to deepen trust and connection. I yearn
  to share a spiritual path, creating purpose beyond ourselves and
  helping us recalibrate when things go awry.

- And there is more! But to meet my needs not to engage in self-therapy
  in this document, and to be respectful for the need for conciseness, I
  will stop here. So many learning edges, so many opportunities to work
  on them.

###  

### Feedback Received

Receiving feedback is something I value. It meets needs for authenticity
and the potential to deepen connection, and to learn. Also potential for
celebration!

It's disappointing that I haven't gotten as much feedback as I would
like. I probably have more than 10 instances of feedback (not always
written) from participants, but not 10 from Certified Trainers.

I celebrate, but feel a little uncomfortable, that most of the feedback
I receive is in the "needs met" category. It is sweet that practitioners
see me modeling the process in real time with what comes up in a
workshop, and to be seen for my compassion (which I don't always see in
myself), my warmth and humor. I'm comfortable leading structured and
unstructured sessions and love when "live" issues come up, which happens
not infrequently. That's kind of the point.

I particularly enjoyed this quote from a participant from my Wilmington
one day workshop in April 2023: "\... he used language that was easy to
understand by a lay person who is new to the process."

That is in contrast from feedback from a July 2019 workshop from a
participant, who, while generally positive about the experience " I find
your energy and your enthusiasm for NVC very engaging and I believe, as
a former teacher, that it helps hold the interest of the group. I find
that your-easy manner and personality help create a pleasant atmosphere
and contributes to a sense of safety in the room. You are clearly
knowledgeable and that comes across well." also had this to say
"Sometimes you appeared to be a little prone to rambling - something I
do and enjoy for the most part but something that might not be helpful
to more linear and organized learners. Can be confusing, hard to follow,
or people might lose interest."

I don't know if this shows progress or not, because there are few data
points. My experience of myself is that I generally share clearly, but
on occasion may ramble. And if I ramble, I think that I have the ability
to recognize when there is disconnection and check back in with the
group. I'm confident that when I hear this kind of feedback from a
participant, I can adjust in real-time.

With the Wilmington group, I received five feedback forms from that
workshop alone, which is really touching, and a testament to the
organization of their local leadership. But my favorite feedback was
from someone who did not attend. One of the co-leaders was not able to
make the session, but I received a card in the mail from her a couple of
months after the workshop: "Neal, Thanks again for all the sharing and
learning. It is helping, Karen." I take that as meaning that it
increased the richness of group interaction and more aligned with NVC
principles.

The most recent workshop I ran was on Zoom in January of this year, with
two participants I had met through Aya Caspi's online workshop on
conflict resolution. They both felt very engaged and enjoyed that it
started unstructured, with no agenda, and became more structured as we
built the experience together. We are trying to set up a monthly zoom
call to continue.

I also want to share one of my favorite celebrations of learning from a
workshop that Sasha and I led in 2019 called "Loving Your Jackals". One
of the participants, Robin P. , told me that the workshop saved her
thousands of hours in therapy. I bumped into her just this year, 2025,
at a New Year's party and she reiterated that the workshop stayed with
her, and helped her appreciate that her jackals were merely messengers,
and to try and find the message in their expressions.

My biggest mourning recently, and ongoing learning, recently, was a
practice group I led that had an expression from a white male (but
long-time NVC practitioner) that landed to some as misogynistic. Likely
their needs for inclusion, respect, and mutuality were not met. I played
one of Marshall's recordings in which he talked about the domination
structures in our society. That's when the male participant said
something like Kamala Harris is the presidential nominee, so that shows
that the domination structure discussion is out of date, that doesn't
exist anymore. I was struck by that statement myself and I tried
connecting to that person to see what was going on for them, but I was
not able to successfully connect with them (they later apologized for
that.) But what I didn't attend to was the impact to others in the room,
and I did not receive that feedback until a month later, through an
incidental discussion. I'm definitely still sitting with that one, but I
do wish I had checked in with the community to see who was impacted and
if they wanted to share anything. Sad about that. Serving marginalized
groups is important to me, and I want to learn how to be an effective
ally, and remain in integrity with the process.

On the flip side, an example of spontaneous feedback that I enjoyed,
relative to my Weaving Water Cohousing Community is the following:

I have received spontaneous feedback, which I can celebrate. One of my
favorites is from my Weaving Water neighbor, K.M.. We both noticed some
dysfunction at a recent Plenary (aka business meeting).

I texted: "If I wasn\'t going through so many life changes, I have
energy to try and contribute. But I have way too much going on
(including a couple of good things. 🙂 )"

K.M. responded: "\...

I think you are continuously contributing! And I deeply appreciate your
contributions.

I'm happy to hear you have some good things going on 🥰"

Two recent things that had happened, that I think K.M. may have been
referring to include:

- A conflict I had with a neighbor that I resolved in a collaborative
  and visible way, that seemed to touch a number of people.

- Sharing a value/need that I had on an email thread with the Care &
  Counsel Committee , that seemed to directly inspire a member to share
  valuable information with the whole community, that she seemed
  reluctant to, before hearing my expression of my value.

- Maybe other things.

### Ongoing Efforts to Receive Feedback

- Certified Instructor/Assessor - took a workshop from Stephanie
  Bachmann Mattei in January, in North Carolina. I offered feedback on
  the workshop, which she said she would like. I provided by email and
  asked for feedback for how I showed up. Nothing back so far and it's
  been a few weeks.

- Local NVC community - in process. I asked Eileen McAvoy to administer
  it on my behalf so that it can be anonymous.

- Weaving Water Cohousing Community - I spoke with a couple of community
  members about how to best get feedback from the community.
  Unfortunately, they thought it is a bad time to ask for such feedback
  for a number of reasons. An idea that came up that I like is to hold
  an event to celebrate, mourn, and provide and receive feedback when I
  exit the community. This feels very organic and I plan to do that. I
  don't have a timeline since we need to find someone to purchase my
  unit before I can have concrete plans to leave.

- Small group of NVC practitioners with whom I have shared a lot. Doug
  Farnum (who attended the 2018 CALF Retreat, but is not part of CALF),
  Sasha Tsyupka (Certification Candidate in CALF), and Eileen McAvoy
  (Certification Candidate on hold), have been a big part of my journey
  over a number of years (varies), and have held space and been held by
  me, have collaborated with me on trainings or practice groups, and
  have generally been aware of the challenges in my life. I expect I
  will get feedback from all three of them shortly.

- Reached out to Amanda and Sheri, since we knew each other from the
  CALF retreat, stayed in contact for several years afterwards, and they
  are CTs. But, it's been a while and they may not have anything "alive"
  for themselves. (NB: Amanda has offered to provide feedback! I'm very
  excited about this.)

2024 - Transforming Conflict at Home and Beyond with NonViolent
Communication with Aya Caspi

I definitely remember taking more online workshops, and some in person
ones. For example, got to meet Marshall one time at a workshop somewhere
around 2004-2006 with my then wife, Amy. It was just a few hours. I also
took a workshop or two with Carol Bruce, who was a local trainer, also
early in my NVC journey. I've definitely jumped on some online offerings
too.

It doesn't ask in the CPP, but I've also led, or co-led a number of
trainings, including, but not limited to:

- Self Empathy workshop - July 2017, as an assistant along with Eileen,
  Sasha, Carl Theodore, and Bob Gailer (Bob was instrumental in keeping
  the NVC light burning in our area, and sadly passed away several years
  before Covid.). I see in my notes that I learned a lot about
  presenting NVC in this workshop.

- What We Need Now - NonViolent Communication, August 2017 - a
  presentation to the Ethical Humanist Society, Chapel Hill, NC. I had
  assistance from my dearest friend Artura Lobo who passed away from
  ovarian cancer in 2018. She was instrumental in my NVC journey. There
  was something magical about this presentation. We were allotted 40
  minutes and they asked us to continue for another 20 minutes because
  they were so engaged. I had a lot of people coming up to me afterwards
  and I could tell it had an impact.

- Giraffe Fuel for Life - November 2017 - in Durham.

- NVC Training for Village Hearth Cohousing, April 2018, Durham, NC.
  Co-lead with Eileen.

- Loving Your Jackals - October 2018. Co-lead with Sasha. I would like
  to do this one again sometime. Possibly rename it for people who are
  new to NVC and may not know what "Jackals" represents.

- NVC Training for Village Hearth Cohousing - March 9/10, 2019 - II was
  invited back to do another training, which felt like recognition of
  the value I brought before. Sasha agreed to assist. During the
  training, someone strongly critiqued my presentation, saying my shirt
  wasn't professional, my posture (legs too far apart) was distracting,
  and I used too many verbal fillers. It was intense, but I invited him
  to use this as a learning moment and demo NVC for the community. He
  consented. After a brief connection, he shared that his heart rate had
  gone down, and he felt calmer and more relaxed. However, when he asked
  if I would change all of my behaviors, I responded authentically (not
  angrily or defensively) with, 'No,' which retriggered him. In my
  debrief with Sylvia, I realized his request reflected a deeper need to
  feel heard and trust that I cared about his needs. This was a BIG
  learning moment, and I've applied this insight several times since.

- Intro to NVC - March 2019 at the Living Arts Collective in Durham.
  Solo lead on this one. I got to model the process when the organizer
  inadvertently invited in new people during a sensitive part of the
  workshop. Went well!

- Intro to NVC - July 2019 - Unity Church - co-lead with Eileen. Was
  hard to evaluate this one for some reason, but we had seven
  participants sign up for our TriNVC (Tri = Triangle; short for
  Research Triangle Park or RTP) email list.

- Staying in Dialogue - November 2019 - co-lead with Eileen. Used the
  Dance floors, which I enjoyed and may want to dive deeper into using.
  Enjoy the kinesthetic aspect of this.

- Intro to NVC - November 2019. Solo lead on this one. From my notes,
  this one looks like it was particularly rich. A friend of mine felt
  like she got NVC for the first time - "rang a bell" for her. Another
  said they had the experience for the first time of listening without
  coming up with strategies. Another was inspired to consider how she
  might use NVC to connect with her son. I noted that I may want to use
  more written materials in the future.

- How to be an effective empathy buddy and Deepening Self Connection -
  December 2019. Co-lead with Doug Farnum. This had some magic in it
  too. One of the participants went really deep in their pain around
  connecting with their son. Doug held space. The person experienced a
  piece of healing that they said they didn't need to come back to
  anymore.

- Intro to NVC - Zoom - April 2021. Co-led with Sasha for a group in
  Winston-Salem. I was happy we presented the purpose of NVC, but not
  happy because I didn't feel as present as I would have liked.

- Intro to NVC - Zoom - March 2022 - co-led with Sasha for the Duke
  University Sanford School of business. From what I can remember, went
  well. Can't find my notes.

- NVC "Live" - April 2023 - met with a practice group in Wilmington, NC,
  live. Went with what was alive. Very rich session and I felt a lot of
  appreciation from the group and got some great feedback. Still in
  connection with them and feel a rich connection.

- I've led or co-led many practice groups both in-person and online.

## Statement of purpose in becoming a CNVC Certified Trainer

I began the process of becoming a CNVC Certified Trainer to deepen my
commitment to learning and living NVC and to connect with supportive
NVC-related communities. While the journey unfolded differently than I
expected, it has strengthened my practice and expanded my connections.

My purpose remains unchanged, but my strategy and energy have evolved. I
see NVC as central to the next phase of my professional life.
Certification will enhance my visibility and deepen connections, opening
doors to share NVC more widely and cultivate meaningful collaborations.
I envision building a strong NVC community within the RTP area (Research
Triangle Park) and establishing a statewide network in North Carolina.
Over the years, we've grown our Meetup group to 483 members and our
email list to 130 subscribers. Recently, we launched discussions on
expanding and enhancing the Durham NVC Practice Group and have shared
the idea of a North Carolina network with a practice group in
Wilmington. I'm energized by the potential to strengthen these
connections and contribute to meaningful change.

Becoming a CNVC Certified Trainer also allows me to engage more deeply
with the Certified Trainer community and CNVC organization. I hope to
contribute to these spaces, fostering an even stronger, more
interdependent force for change (see Key Differentiations:
Interdependence vs. dependence or independence).

I see my future as one of heightened interconnectedness, not only within
the NVC community but also in my broader work toward positive social
change.

##  

## Key Differentiations (KDs)

I addressed the KD of love as an action, need, or feeling earlier in the
document. In this section I will explore four more that hold meaning and
challenge for me.

### Idiomatic (Street Giraffe) vs classical (formal) Giraffe. 

Classical Giraffe is based on OFNR, essentially sensing feelings and
needs and expressing them explicitly. Idiomatic, or Street Giraffe, is
saying things in a way that is less formal and might especially be more
appropriate for connecting to those to whom OFNR feels foreign or rigid.

I chose this KD because I've experienced firsthand how painful it can be
when a well-intentioned attempt to translate Classical Giraffe into
Idiomatic lands as advice or strategy instead of connection. I've also
noticed that guessing feelings and needs doesn't always land, and other
approaches I've tried to connect seem to vary in effectiveness.

I used to think about Idiomatic Giraffe like using Google Translate for
NVC. You just take the feelings and needs guesses; plug it in; and
voilá, the perfect Street Giraffe translation appears. But the work of
real connection isn't about plugging words into a formula, it's about
sensing what is alive and responding from that energy.

How do I know the differentiation? If I am stuck in my languaging, using
feelings and needs, but it is clearly not landing, then I may be leaning
too heavily on OFNR. If I am staying focused on what's in my heart, and
sensing what is in the other person's heart, and speaking in a more
fluid way, then I am engaging in Idiomatic Giraffe.

A good example of Idiomatic Giraffe comes from a Rita-Ism:

> *\| A woman tells Rita that her husband was diagnosed with cancer. Her
> empathic response : "Difficult road ahead."*

What makes this Idiomatic Giraffe?

- Not explicitly guessing feelings and needs.

- Sensing what is most important to the woman, in that moment.

- Using simple, heartfelt, honest words to convey connection and
  presence.

In both OFNR and Idiomatic Giraffe you want to sense where the other
person is, and sense what is in your own heart, the difference is that
the delivery of Idiomatic Giraffe is less likely to be received as
formulaic, or foreign. OFNR might be received that way, even if it is
done skillfully, because it is not the norm in our culture. That being
said, sometimes OFNR lands beautifully, even in its structured form. It
depends on the moment. When to use OFNR is also an intuitive choice.

How to share? : I can think of a couple of relationships in which I have
trouble connecting. I intend to spend some time "workshopping" how I can
stay connected but use different words and then try and apply them to
daily life. If I can live it, I can model it. If I can model it, I can
share/teach it.

### Interdependence vs dependence or independence. 

I chose this KD because I see my path forward as centered on
interdependence to effect social change.

- Independence means relying solely on oneself and functioning without
  depending on others.

- Dependence signifies a reliance on someone or something else to meet
  needs.

- Interdependence refers to a mutual reliance where individuals depend
  on each other to achieve goals.

Independence and dependence are illusions to some extent.
Interdependence more accurately reflects reality. Even in tasks that
seem independent, like driving to work, eating a meal, or writing on a
computer, I rely on the labor, resources, and creativity of others.
Likewise, these systems rely on my participation to function.

A new insight for me is that dependence, independence, and
interdependence are not fixed states but more like a continuum that we
live on, constantly changing and in flux moment-to-moment. The factors
that come up for me most when considering this continuum are external
circumstances, choice, impact, and power. External circumstances include
health events, aging, cultural norms, and institutional structures.

For example, in August 2024, I fainted at home, injured myself, and had
to call 911. I was dependent on emergency responders and hospital staff
for care. Yet, even in that dependence, I had choices. Whether to call
for help, follow medical advice, or stay home.

Interdependence invites us to acknowledge and accept our circumstances
while staying connected to choice.

Out of the spirit of independence, I make a thousand choices daily
without asking anyone's advice or permission.

Interdependence invites us to be conscious that our choices may impact
people, animals, plants, and the environment, locally and globally,
whether intentionally or not.

*How I live interdependence* -

I practice interdependence in my cohousing community by giving,
receiving, and co-creating a heart-centered environment. Though
preparing to leave, I carry that spirit of collaboration with me.

Another way to practice interdependence is to be more conscious of my
choices. As I write this, I notice it doesn't feel like play, and I have
some inner resistance. A place to come back to explore.

*How I share interdependence -*

I practice interdependence in NVC workshops and practice groups by
explicitly inviting shared ownership of our learning and mutual support.
I encourage participants to make requests when something in the session
isn't working for them, and I adjust my facilitation based on community
feedback and needs.

### Observation vs observation mixed with evaluation

I chose this KD because observation plays a crucial role in my
self-empathy practice. One way I use it is when reading texts or emails.
If I feel triggered, I've found that waiting before rereading helps me
see the message more as a pure observation rather than through the lens
of my initial reaction and interpretations. Interpretations can lead to
emotional reactions that can stir anger, discouragement, or
disconnection. When I shift to pure observation, I gain a clearer sense
of the author's intention, which in turn cultivates curiosity and deeper
understanding.

*How I know it:*

Observation is what a camera can observe of external behaviors and
events. For example, you can't observe anger, because that is an
internal state. But you can observe a furrowed brow, a red face, a
widened posture and that their voice got louder. Interpretation is a way
to try and make sense of these things by assigning labels like angry,
flustered, etc.

*How I live it:*

In my self empathy practice, I notice my feelings, body sensations, and
thoughts as they arise. I start with a clear observation, free from
interpretation, whether it's an external event, like the text of an
email or something someone said, or an internal reaction, like
self-criticism (jackal in) or judgment of another (jackal out).

If I begin with an external observation, I follow the feelings it
stimulates and track the energy in my body until I connect with my
needs. If I start with a critical voice, I empathize with it rather than
resist it. The Educator/Chooser model helps me recognize the needs
behind my inner judgments and the needs behind my choices. When I
connect with all the needs present, I often experience a softening, a
shift toward greater self connection and ease.

*How I share it:*

In NVC intros, Eileen McAvoy and I often play an observation game where
one of us silently acts out various activities. We then ask participants
what they observed and categorize their responses using the OEFP
framework: Observation, Evaluation, Feeling, and Purpose. This exercise
often leads to aha moments as participants notice how naturally
interpretations arise and how they can sometimes create disconnection.
It's a playful yet eye-opening way to explore the distinction between
observation and evaluation.

### Respect for authority vs. fear of authority

Relationship with authority is a key learning edge for me, potentially
deepening my growth and fostering hope around this issue. It also ties
to the FirstGen NVCer retreat, where viewing the FirstGeners as
authorities on NVC could be easy. This event may challenge how I choose
to express myself, either holding back or sharing in ways that might
unintentionally feel disconnected from others.

The word "authority" has multiple dimensions:

- It can derive from expertise and knowledge, where authority is
  recognized as a result of skills and contributions.

- It can also be granted by a structural hierarchy or a role with
  responsibility in an organization.

These two forms of authority seem distinct to me, yet both present
opportunities and challenges in my relationship to power.

*How do I know the difference?*

Respect for authority acknowledges expertise or the responsibility of a
given role, but it requires staying connected to the humanity of the
person in authority. If I feel fear or an urge to submit, rebel, or
hide, these are signs that I may not be connecting with their humanity
or my own.

For example, in my previous role as a program manager at the Linux
Foundation, I often experienced challenging interactions with Steve G.,
a volunteer community treasurer for one of my open source projects. I
experienced his behavior as bullying but felt too intimidated to speak
up, often resorting to the conflict strategy of accommodating. This
situation left me disconnected from my own needs, leading to ineffective
team dynamics and personal pain. When I attempted to seek support from
my manager, I found him to be conflict-avoidant, reinforcing the
pattern.

This painful experience highlights the Key Differentiation (KD): when
respect for authority comes from connection, I feel grounded in my
perspective and sense of choice. However, fear of authority often arises
when I feel powerless, disconnected from my needs, and caught in
patterns like submission or rebellion.

Connecting with the humanity of those in authority opens up greater
possibilities for mutual respect and collaboration. I can value their
expertise, role, and responsibility while maintaining my own sense of
agency and interdependence.

*How do I live this difference?*

As a leader, I aim to earn authority through my behaviors, knowledge,
skills, and actions that add value to my community. In this sense,
authority is a gift, not something gained through coercion. I see it as
my responsibility to reduce the intimidation that authority can create,
bridging the distance it may cause by fostering shared humanity and
values, especially with marginalized groups who may have an additional
level of trauma with which to contend.

At the FirstGen Retreat, I intend to live this value by respecting the
FirstGeners' authority, grounded in their experience and knowledge. At
the same time, I aim to challenge myself to express myself
authentically, even though this may push against my fear of "using too
many words" or my trauma around "being seen." Staying self-connected and
present will be my priority, trusting the words that come to me in the
moment. And, failing that, coming back to empathizing with myself,
reconnecting, and accepting myself for who I am if things don't go the
way I would prefer.

How do I share this difference?

This very much feels connected to how I share independence and model
leadership and authority.

## What Would Truly Support Me

\|*"My honesty is my gift to you. " - Rita Herzog*

Sylvia, I deeply appreciate so much about this process, especially your
clarity in communicating the request-based nature of it. In our
relationship, I've most valued the moments of vulnerability,
authenticity, and the sharing of mournings. I've also been challenged to
deepen my self-reflection and strengthen my NVC practice, which has been
a meaningful learning experience.

However, it may come as no surprise that I've experienced some bumps
along the road in our relationship. At the 2018 CALF Retreat, we both
seemed to resonate with the image of walking a path together---a path
where, if it no longer worked for either of us, we could let each other
know and perhaps reconnect further along the journey.

Two things that have felt difficult for me:

- There have been moments when I felt I was at that point---exploring
  something different---but it seemed that my sharing stimulated sadness
  or mourning for you.

- Second, there have been times when I've experienced some of your
  feedback landing as judgments or diagnoses rather than curiosities or
  mutual explorations. In those moments, I've felt a bit defensive.

I am curious if either of these experiences resonate for you? I'm
wondering if you would be open to connecting and exploring them?
Relationship and learning are important values to me, and what I would
be hoping to strengthen through the discussion.

#### Looking Ahead

Looking ahead, I'm shifting my focus toward social change, with NVC at
the center of my work. This transition feels both exhilarating and a
little daunting.

To support my development as a trainer and practitioner, I'm seeking
opportunities to deepen my skills and expand my experience.
Specifically, I am interested in:

- Shadowing live conflict resolution sessions (preferably in-person,
  though virtual opportunities are welcome).

- Assisting experienced trainers in mediations and workshops.

- Leading trainings with experienced trainers present to offer feedback.

I welcome insights, ideas, or connections that could support me in this
phase of growth. I did take Aya's online conflict resolution workshop,
which was helpful, but not enough for me to feel competent to try and
apply the work. I'm open to additional learnings, but I suspect having
more live and experiential events will contribute more deeply for me.

Do you have any recommendations? Or recommendations of who I might talk
with to explore this further?

## Conclusion - A Journey of Love and Fear

*\| "peace cannot be built on the foundations of fear". - Marshall*

As I reflect on this process of creating a pre-assessment portfolio, I
feel amazed that it was as enriching an experience as it was. I could
not have imagined that in advance. I'm grateful for the opportunity to
do a deep introspective dive in a way that I have seldom, if ever, done.
And certainly not within a compressed time frame. I am grateful for this
opportunity and the opportunity to freely express, learn, and be
surprised.

A while ago, Eileen shared an idea that deeply resonated with me: we are
always attempting to meet our needs from either a place of Love or Fear.
This insight has stayed with me and continues to shape my understanding
of NVC consciousness. When my actions are driven by fear, they tend to
feel life-alienating, disconnecting me from myself and others. In
contrast, when I am fully present, my actions are more life-serving and
foster deeper connection. On a daily basis, I notice a mixture of love
and fear in my actions. NVC has been instrumental in guiding me toward
love and presence, which I deeply yearn for, even as I sometimes fear
it.

I created this document to meet my own needs. I feel at peace with that,
though a little nervous how it will land. I aimed to align with the CPP
requests and your expectations, Sylvia, as my assessor. While I would
have preferred a more collaborative approach, I now offer collaboration
moving forward. I'm curious to hear how this document works for you, or
doesn't, and to explore together if any unmet needs remain.

I conclude this document with openness to your feedback, a hope for
meaningful collaboration, and appreciation for myself, for the effort
I've put into this process. I also want to acknowledge the role your
support has played in getting me here, even with the bumpy moments along
the way. I couldn't have done it without you.

### Peace by Neal

What that looks like to me is crying, being connected to the beauty of
mourning,

What that looks like to me is crying, being touched by a human moment.

What that looks like to me is playing,

Together,
