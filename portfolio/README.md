**Welcome**

This folder holds a personal document I created for my CNVC certification assessment. Although it began as a private matter, I felt moved to share it openly. Writing it was fun and inspirational for me. Parts of it might offer others on their NVC path inspiration or curiosity (which in turn could lead to learning). I am not representing any of my material as answers to NVC questions, but rather my own internal exploration of the topics included. 

My assessor/accompanier, Sylvia Haskvitz, offered reflections and questions that supported my growth in meaningful ways. I’ve chosen not to include her commentary here, both because I haven’t asked her permission and because her insights feel like something to hold with a bit more privacy and care.

Thank you for being here.
